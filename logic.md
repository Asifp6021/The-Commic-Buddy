we are going to use oops coding style.

we are going to build site where we can keep track of all the superheroesEntry by adding it and deleting it.

***************** step 1 ****************

so we have to add superhero name, and univers and what power they poses.

for that created class SupreheroEntery class and added parameter to cunstructor.

and created superherolist all the methods for deleting and adding going to be in this class.


***************** step 2 ****************
addeed event listener on the button and created some variable and grab the value of the input and assign it. and i used array distructure for it.

***************** step 3 ****************

//instantiating the SuperHeroEntry class and SuperHeroList

created methods for the superHeroList to addSuperHero and passed it superHeroEntry entry as parameter.

i am going to store data into local storage and for that i created new class StoreSuperHero(). and i used static.  

i used static because when we use static we don't need to intantisiate it. we don't have to write more code and our code remains cleaner.

go and read about static.
